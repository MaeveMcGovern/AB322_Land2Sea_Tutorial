## Preface

Downstream impacts of terrestrial inputs on coastal waters can be dramatic, with impacts on light climate, nutrient availability and contamination in fjord surface waters (McGovern et al., 2020). However, these impacts are shaped by the characteristics of the inflowing freshwater, with concentrations of suspended sediments, nutrients, and contaminants varying among river catchments.



## Ackowledgements
Water chemistry data used in this tutorial include published data (McGovern et al., 2020) and unpublished data collected by NIVA under the NFR project 'TerrACE'and Framcenter project "FreshFate"; PI, Amanda Poste. In addition, some of the data used here are generated for teaching purposes.
