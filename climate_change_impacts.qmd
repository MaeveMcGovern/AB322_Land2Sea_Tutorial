# Climate Change Impacts

Now, we will combine data on catchment characteristics and river water chemistry to investigate climate change impacts for Isfjorden in a space-for-time approach

Climate variables:

1. Glacier coverage

2. NDVI (greening)

In Arctic regions, most river runoff is constrained to the summer melt season due to seasonal variations in sunlight and temperature. Despite their importance, for simplification, we do not account for seasonal variability in river discharge and water chemistry in this example.
