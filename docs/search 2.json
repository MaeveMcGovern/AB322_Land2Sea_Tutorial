Go to the R website and follow the links for downloading.\nR for Windows: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/.\nR for Macs: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/.\nR-studio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/\nOnce you have Rstudio installed, click on File/New File/Rscript. We will use this new Rscript file for loading, cleaning and plotting catchment and river water chemistry data throughout this tutorial.\n\n\n\nIn addition, you will need to install several R packages. You can do this by copying and running the following lines of code in your new Rscript.\n\n#install.packages(\"tidyverse\") \n#install.packages(\"vegan\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis book was created using Quarto."

    "text": "Downstream impacts of terrestrial inputs on coastal waters can be dramatic, with impacts on light climate, nutrient availability and contamination in fjord surface waters (McGovern et al., 2020). However, these impacts are shaped by the characteristics of the inflowing freshwater, with concentrations of suspended sediments, carbon, nutrients, and contaminants varying among river catchments with differing morphology, geology, vegetation cover, and glacial coverage (refs). In the Arctic, river catchments are spatially heterogeneous, seasonally variable, and facing rapid changes with climate warming.\nClimate change impacts on cross-ecosystem transport of solutes from Arctic catchments to coastal waters is driven both by changes in discharge, and in water chemistry. Discharge is increasing for many Arctic rivers due to increases in precipitation, glacial melt and permafrost thaw. In addition, thawing catchments and increased vegetative biomass ‘Arctic Greening’, are leading to changes in river water chemistry, with implications for receiving coastal waters.\nIn this tutorial, we will explore two cross-boundary fluxes of carbon, nutrients and contaminants: (1) from catchment soils to rivers, and (2) from rivers to sea."
